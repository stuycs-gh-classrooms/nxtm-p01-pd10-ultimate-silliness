Issue One) From NATHANIEL MOY & CONNER MEYER
Cool things:

    Your documentation is very cool because it is extremely detailed
    Your methods and functions are listed very cleanly, with return types and parameters listed. Good job !

Clarifying Qs:

    Why are you not using 1D arrays?
    How will you keep track of all the different stages (i.e. different block arrangements as the user progresses through levels)

Suggestions:

    Make use of 1D arrays please
    Implement more ways to control the game through the mouse

Issue Two) Feedback from Hugo Kudera and Tyler Lin 
Hugo Kudera and Tyler Lin

Cool things:
The next stage would button is an interesting add
Levelcomplete might be cool if theres like a win screen

Clarifying things:
What exactly would screenSize do?
Theres no brick as your classes

Suggestions:

Use a 1D array to give each brick multiple lives
Start the game paused
